    <br>
    <br>
    General:
    There are 2 sides, Black and White.  Both alternate taking turns by moving a piece, starting with white.  The objective of the game is to checkmate the enemy king, meaning that they are being attacked by one of your pieces and they cannot escape.
    <br>
    <br>
    Pieces:
    <br>
    Pawn - ♟
    Pawns can move forward, towards the enemy backline.  They typically move one space at a time, though they can move forward 2 spaces on their first turn. Pawns can capture other pieces diagonally - forward one and to either side.  If they reach the final rank on the other side of the board, they can promote to another piece; Rook, Bishop, Knight, or Queen.
    <br>
    <br>
    Rook - ♜
    Rooks can move infinite spaces horizontally or vertically, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Knight - ♞
    Knights move 2 spaces in 1 direction, and 1 space perpendicular to the first direction - making an L shape.  They can 'jump' over other pieces.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bishop - ♝
    Bishops can move infinite spaces diagonally, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Queen - ♛
    Queens can move infinite spaces diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.
    <br>
    <br>
    King - <a href="/easter">♚</a>
    Kings can move a single space in any direction.
    <br>
