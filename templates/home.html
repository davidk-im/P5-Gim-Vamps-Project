    <h2 class="myH2">How To Play</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="myP">General:
        There are 2 sides, Black and White.  Both alternate taking turns by moving a piece, starting with white.  The objective of the game is to checkmate the enemy king, meaning that they are being attacked by one of your pieces and they cannot escape.</p>
    <p class="myP">Pieces:
        <br>
        Pawn - ♟
        Pawns can move forward, towards the enemy backline.  They typically move one space at a time, though they can move forward 2 spaces on their first turn. Pawns can capture other pieces diagonally - forward one and to either side.  If they reach the final rank on the other side of the board, they can promote to another piece; Rook, Bishop, Knight, or Queen.
        <br></a></p>
    <p class="myP">Rook - ♜
        Rooks can move infinite spaces horizontally or vertically, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.
        <br></p>
    <p class="myP">    Knight - ♞
        Knights move 2 spaces in 1 direction, and 1 space perpendicular to the first direction - making an L shape.  They can 'jump' over other pieces.
        <br></p>
    <p class="myP">Bishop - ♝
        Bishops can move infinite spaces diagonally, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.</p>
    <p class="myP">Queen - ♛
        Queens can move infinite spaces diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, as long as there are no other pieces in the way.</p>
    <p class="myP">    King - <a href="/easter">♚</a>
        Kings can move a single space in any direction.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="myP">Special Moves:<br>
    <p class="myP">
        Castling -
        Provided these conditions are met, the king will move 2 spaces towards either rook, and the rook will move past to the other side of the king.

    <p class="myP">1. The king and rook being used have not been moved.</p>

    <p class="myP">2. The king is not in check, moving through check, or moving into check</p>
    <p class="myP">En Passant -

        1. The opposing pawn is directly to the left or right of the attacking pawn
        2. The opposing pawn had moved forward 2 spaces the turn before
        The attacking pawn will then capture, moving forward and toward the enemy pawn</p>
