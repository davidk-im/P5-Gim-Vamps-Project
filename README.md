## README Guidance 
### Planning on [Scrumboard](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1)
### Major Technicals:
* Web API(David)
* ELO System(Kyle)
    * [Repl.it demonstration of the system](https://repl.it/@KyleMyint/Chess-ELO-System#main.py), thought process, and equations
        * Wow and thought process explained in comments in repl link
        * How to run:
        * Run repl (linked above)
        * Choose a mode and enter 1 or 2 of the usernames (found in accounts.txt)
    * When a game ends, the [elo function](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/elopupdate.py) is run, and the results are used to edit the user database with the new scores.
* Databases(Ava)
    * Chess.db holds 3 tables: user([found here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/user.py#L12-L22)), game, and game_move(both found [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L8-L17)
        * User holds username/password info as well as ELO stats
        * Game holds game ids
            * Back end where game is created on [replaygame.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L18-L34)
* Signup/Login
    * Signup form is created on [signup.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html) where users input username and password
        * Includes elements of HTML5 [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html#L14) and java script [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html#L33-L45)
    * User_create function in [user.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/user.py#L30-L35) creates user and sends data to chess.db and default ELO scores are added
        * Back end uses POST to get info on [flaskmain.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py#L111-L121)
        * If successful, user is redirected to a signup confirm page
    * Login form is created on [login.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/login.html)
        * Uses validate_user function on [user.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/user.py#L46-L53) to check for inputted username in the database
            * Back end uses POST and calls validate_user function
            * If username is found and passwords match, user will be logged in
            * Login function uses flask attributes such as login_required, @login_manager.user.loader, and login_user
    * Profile.html page uses login_required
        * [Flaskmain.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py#L74-L77) grabs session info for username and 3 ELO scores which are displayed on [profile.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/profile.html) using jinja variables
    * How to run:
        1. If you are a new user, create an account by signing up
        2. Once signed up, you can either go straight to playing, or log in to see your current stats. 
        3. Start playing
* Raspberry Pi(Lucas)
    * Port forwarded Pi IP using internet console dashboard, this way other users can connect to it when the server is online.'
    * Used a free domain website to create a custom domain for the website that cloaks the original IP. ([URL](chessoffline.cf)
    * Runs on Gunicorn and Nginx
    * Since the Pi is always on, it runs 24/7!
    * Able to clone project on Pi using 'git clone' and can easily update with 'git pull'
* WOW(chess)(Ava/Kyle/David)
    * Creating game and storing data:
        * Each game id is unique using get_next_game function [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L26-L41)
        * Functions [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/chessdata.py#L277-L303) on chessdata.py get usermove1, usermove2, color of the move, and the number in sequence of the move
        * Saves to database after each turn is done [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py#L184-L196) by calling [this function](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L19-L23) from chessdata.py
    * Replaying a Game
        * Games are sorted by gameid in database
        * Use post to submit form with entered game id [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py#L127-L137)
        * Calls [get_game_replay](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L43-L45) function that query's through database to find game id
        * Data is then printed accordingly [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/replaygamedata.html#L20-L28) using jinja forloops and variables
    * How to run:
        * Start new multiplayer game
            *Can play or just move a few pieces around for testing purposes
        * Remember game ID
        * Input game ID into replay game under play menu(some games with data already include 24 and 33)

### Incorporating College Board Requirements: 
* Creative development
   * Use collaboration and program design and development to learn how these 2 topics are very important to creating programs
* Data
   * Use data compression and extracting information from data to explore how computers use and handle data to produce information and solve problems
* Algorithms and programming
   * Use algorithms and simulations to create programs that solve problems or show creativity
   * Algorithmic efficiency 
* Computer systems and networks
   * How computers and network systems work using the internet and parallel distributed computing
   * How to use multiple computers to split up work and make process faster
* Impact of computing/ethics
   * Effect of computing on society, economy, culture, and everyday life
   * Legal and ethical responsibilities as a programmer
   * Digital divide, computing bias, and safe computing
* Practiced not voicing over for [commerical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gtWMTjAztI) which are the requirements for the final project

### Incorporating Tech Talks
* Databases
    * CRUD
        * Create, read, update, delete
        * Use different data types(INT, String, ETC) and parameters(primary_key, notnull, null, etc) to create table
    * One db, chess.db in project
        * 3 tables: user created in ([user.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/user.py#L12-L22)), game_move and game created in [replaygame.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/replaygamehtml.py#L8-L23)
        * Used for user creation and storing information from chess games(move number, color move, etc)     
* HTML 5/JS
    * Used attributes such as min and max length, input required, and place holders [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html#L11-L27)
    * Used JS functions to validate passwords matching[here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html#L33-L44)
* REST APIs
    * Used [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/webapi2.html)(front end) using jinja variables and loops
    * Backend [here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py#L180-L190)
    * Data is pulled from lichess and displays ranked players on different sites
* Lists/dictionaries



## Summary: 
Create a chess-based website using Python, Flask, SQLAlchamy, and a Raspberry Pi with an internet domain that has the following features:
* Username/Password login system w/ profiles
    * Profiles show data from database about stats
* Database of profiles with statistics based on previous games
* Play against other players, or against an AI with different difficulties
* Be able to replay past games from a database and see moves
* Rules & Settings

## Big Ticket Goals:
* A working chess game, integrated into our website
* Profile system using a database, where people can find data such as past games, winrate, etc.
* Menu to navigate to all parts of the website
