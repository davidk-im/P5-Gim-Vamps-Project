Group Members: Kyle Myint, Lucas Bruner, Ava Brooks, David Kim

## README Guidance Highlights
[1.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-55223795) Fix suggestions from crossover and meet CB requirements
* Used feedback from crossover to improve user interface when playing chess
    * Smaller more frequent commits rather than large code dumps
    * Larger chess pieces 
    * Different board size/color
        * Code for both can be found on [ai.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/ai.html) and [chessdicTtable.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/chessDicTtable.html)
    * Made sign up forms more protected with min lengths and required using HTML 5. [Code here](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/signup.html)
* Used [AP CSP Requirements Reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iZbqiswnBJm2gSYM1-ZdOmmyctaelcSxfkG7fHDyDc/edit) to start to make comments, explaining all code
    * Comments on all python files, still working on html files, however most are still being worked on 
* [Commit history](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/commits/main) shows work throughout the week


### 2/18 Tickets/Code Review

[1.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-55227600) Create function to use HTML inputs and check validity using Python
* New functions
   * Modified old user input function to output usable responses and accept incoming data from POST. [See code](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/htmlToPythonAdditions.py)
   * Created new function to take in data and formulate an output to send back to the website. [See code](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/htmlToPython.py)
      * Complete for Player vs Player, but AI hasn't been integrated thus far
[2.] (https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-55337542) Rerouted chess routes so that it was cleaner and that variables would be easier to manage.
* Substituted a variable into the url so that a route to any space would register, without need for 64 routes.
   * [Code] (https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/9ea69f696c9162fd0dde3b4d038bee944feae879/flaskmain.py#L157-L160)
* This should make it easier to take the variable and use it
* Edited minor things in actual html file for chess board

## 1/15 Scrum Team Tickets
[1.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52921614) Create database to store Username and Password information from completing the signup form on signup.py
* Created [flaskmain.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py) with POST method to push username and password information to database. If else statement used, else code used, to test for errors in code. 
* Created [user.py](https://gist.github.com/avabrooks/ea2f743a91e594ddd5afc01387217f3b) to create functions defining the database and the variables in it. 
* Created [chess.db](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/chess.db) to store usernames and passwords. Also created a blank one in case of error. 
* How to run: 
    1. From home page select sign up button. 
    2. Fill out the 3 fields, the form will not go through without filling out all fields.The form will also not go through if your passwords do not match(CSS integration).
    3. After creating your account, you will be redirected to the play menu, where the chess games will soon be implemented.
    4. Example of completed code showing data in database [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FsY9-SmcStAdhVpmfUdrwxXERZDZkiBrXjHaocRAvAM/edit)
    5. Goal for next week: Connect database so users can log in. 
 
[2.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52931009) Design, and create the leaderboards page to eventually be used with a database.
* Created [leaderboards.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/leaderboards.html)
* Used a variety of CSS styles to make it look really beautiful
* How to run:
    1. Starting at the home page, select the leaderboards button.
    2. Scroll down and view various users' ELO, their amount of wins, and their spot on the board.
    3. Eventually, upon completion of a game and gaining/losing some ELO, you can then have the option to go straight to the leaderboards to see where you have moved to.
    
[3.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52619938) Formulate and code the ELO ranking system for users
* Created a [separate repository](https://repl.it/@KyleMyint/Chess-ELO-System#main.py) to keep code for now
* Once the database for users is set up on the website, this code could be integrated in order to give or take away ELO points based on games or puzzles a user completes
* How to run:
    1. Run repl code
    2. Type "1" to see the score for running a tactic puzzle
    3. Type "Alex" to see what score user Alex would recieve after completing said puzzle (Note: in temp 'database', Alex has an initial ELO of 1300 for tactics, and a streak of 3 wins
    4. Type "y" to see what Alex would get if he were to solve the puzzle correctly - in this case, he gains 11 points
    5. Read comments on main.py to see the formula and thought process behind our ELO system.

[4.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52935460) Set up board analysis
* Created a [separate repository](https://repl.it/@Ironfire/ChessBoardAnalyze#main.py) to test outside of the main project.
* With replaygame, we have access to all prior boards, so running analysis on these boards would help players improve.
* How to run:
    1. Run repl code
    2. Typing "1" at the menu will analyze a game one move in.
    3. Typing "2" at the menu will analyze a developed but not yet finished game.
    4. Typing "3" at the menu will analyze a game that you input (note that this takes a long time and a lot of precision).
    5. Comments show reasoning behind analysis.

## Summary: 
Create a chess-based website using Python, Flask, SQLAlchamy, and a Raspberry Pi with an internet domain that has the following features:
* Username/Password login system w/ profiles
* Database of profiles with statistics based on previous games
    * For example, a user could search for their win rate against another user, or find their games with that user
* Be able to view match history, and see game codes to see your past games
* Play against other players, or against an AI with different difficulties
* Be able to replay past games from a database
* Rules & Settings

## Big Ticket Goals:
* A working chess game, integrated into our website
* Profile system using a database, where people can find data such as past games, winrate, etc.
* Menu to navigate to all parts of the website

## Incorporating College Board Requirements: 
* Big Idea 1: Creative Development
    * Use web and program designs to create a plan for the project(project plan in README.md)
    * Create Scrum Boards to track progress and development of the project
    * Use graphics/storyboard to plan the website design 
* Big Idea 2: Data
    * Using a SQLAlchemy database to save user information 
        *Use this information for user login
    *Database for storing information such as past chess games with moves, win/loss statistics, and win rates versus other players
* Big Idea 3: Algorithms and programming
    * Use graphics/storyboard to plan the website design/UI 
        * Want a simple, professional look color and design wise

    * Deploying website using a raspberry pi that runs 24/7
        * Internet domain
    * Using GET/POST
        * User information and login
        * Past game information
* Big Idea 5: Impact of computing
