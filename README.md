### Major Technicals:
* Web API
* ELO System
* Databases
* Signup/Login
* Raspberry Pi
* WOW

### Incorporating College Board Requirements: 
* Creative development
   * Use collaboration and program design and development to learn how these 2 topics are very important to creating programs
* Data
   * Use data compression and extracting information from data to explore how computers use and handle data to produce information and solve problems
* Algorithms and programming
   * Use algorithms and simulations to create programs that solve problems or show creativity
   * Algorithmic efficiency 
* Computer systems and networks
   * How computers and network systems work using the internet and parallel distributed computing
   * How to use multiple computers to split up work and make process faster
* Impact of computing/ethics
   * Effect of computing on society, economy, culture, and everyday life
   * Legal and ethical responsibilities as a programmer
   * Digital divide, computing bias, and safe computing

### Incorporating Tech Talks




## Summary: 
Create a chess-based website using Python, Flask, SQLAlchamy, and a Raspberry Pi with an internet domain that has the following features:
* Username/Password login system w/ profiles
* Database of profiles with statistics based on previous games
    * For example, a user could search for their win rate against another user, or find their games with that user
* Be able to view match history, and see game codes to see your past games
* Play against other players, or against an AI with different difficulties
* Be able to replay past games from a database
* Rules & Settings

## Big Ticket Goals:
* A working chess game, integrated into our website
* Profile system using a database, where people can find data such as past games, winrate, etc.
* Menu to navigate to all parts of the website
