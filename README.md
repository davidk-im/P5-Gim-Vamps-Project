# Project Plan
Group Members: Kyle Myint, Lucas Bruner, Ava Brooks, David Kim

## Summary: 
Create a chess-based website using Python, Flask, SQLAlchamy, and a Raspberry Pi with an internet domain that has the following features:
* Username/Password login system w/ profiles
* Database of profiles with statistics based on previous games
    * For example, a user could search for their win rate against another user, or find their games with that user
* Be able to view match history, and see game codes to see your past games
* Play against other players, or against an AI with different difficulties
* Be able to replay past games from a database
* Rules & Settings

## Big Ticket Goals:
* A working chess game, integrated into our website
* Profile system using a database, where people can find data such as past games, winrate, etc.
* Menu to navigate to all parts of the website

## Incorporating College Board Requirements: 
* Big Idea 1: Creative Development
    * Use web and program designs to create a plan for the project(project plan in README.md)
    * Create Scrum Boards to track progress and development of the project
    * Use graphics/storyboard to plan the website design 
* Big Idea 2: Data
    * Using a SQLAlchemy database to save user information 
        *Use this information for user login
    *Database for storing information such as past chess games with moves, win/loss statistics, and win rates versus other players
* Big Idea 3: Algorithms and programming
    * Use graphics/storyboard to plan the website design/UI 
        * Want a simple, professional look color and design wise
    *Create design with HTML and CSS
* Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks
    * Deploying website using a raspberry pi that runs 24/7
        * Internet domain
    * Using GET/POST
        * User information and login
        * Past game information
* Big Idea 5: Impact of computing
    * Website will not be used for illegal or malicious purposes
    * Players can learn or strengthen their chess skills by using our website
    * User credentials are secure and have protection from database leaks
    * Crediting work from first trimester to those who created that code

## Tracking Sheet/Schedule:
* Found on Repo, created a scrum board found in projects
    * Has 5 tracking steps: backlog, assigned, in progress, ready for deploy, and completed 
* Delivery plans/deadlines for big milestones
* Big ticket features with visuals
